The formatting of the elements is mainly done using the "connecting arrows".
So the alignment of a connection can be done in different ways:

    If there is no direction specified, PlantUML will choose the alignment
    of the connection (up or down / left or right)

    ->      horizontal aligned connection
    -->     vertical aligned connection

    But you can force the alignment to as you desire, by simply
    writing down the direction:
    -up->
    -down->
    -left->
    -right->

    But have in mind that if there are some many-to-many connections,
    PlantUML will not always be able to do 100% as you intended.
    In general it works quite nicely though.
